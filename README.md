# RainRansomware
A project in the beginning. I'm working on the program and I intend to make a non-ultra-powerful ransomware, but that's the job. I'll create the same program in two versions, one in c ++ and the other in python (which I'm working on now). I ask for help from anyone who knows so I can compile the file written in python to exe. Thank you for all the help you can give me. Let's go together forever.  "Respire ad quos ex-vulgo.Vere tu hic habitas?"
