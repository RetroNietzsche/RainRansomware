# RainRansomware
A project in the beginning. I'm working on the program and I intend to make a non-ultra-powerful ransomware, but that's the job. I'll create the same program in two versions, one in c ++ and the other in python (which I'm working on now). I ask for help from anyone who knows so I can compile the file written in python to exe. Thank you for all the help you can give me. Let's go together forever.

  "Respire ad quos ex-vulgo.Vere tu hic habitas?"

This project will be done with the intention of studying the languages previously proposed. I will not be responsible for any use for illegal actions of the content provided here. The application will:

-Encrypt files from three primary directories (desktop, document folder and downloads folder)

-It will create malicious utility files, adding logs and disabling protections so that it infects and becomes permanent inside the machine

-It will change the wallpaper, changing it for "Rain.jpg"

-It will continue encrypting every root directory (C: /, /, ...)

Any other suggestions?
